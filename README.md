# Phoenix API

Thanks for checking out my submission to the GrowFlow coding challenge

I was tasked with creating an API codenamed "Phoenix" that supports CRUD style actions that also syncs with a mock traceability API codenamed "Leviathan".

This node API is written in JavaScript using the Express.js framework for fast simple scaling. 

## Installation Steps for MacOS

Follow these steps to spin up a local server to interact with the Phoenix API:

- Install node and npm [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- See the installation docs for MongoDB [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)
- Install dependencies (Nodemon, express, mongoose) by running ```npm install```
- To start the server, run ```npm start```
- I recommend performing CRUD actions using Postman. You will be hitting the local URL, http://localhost:3000/customer.
